                Hello, My name is Reagan Rogers and I am an aspiring Software Engineer.
                I am currently attending the Ohio State University Fullstack Coding Bootcamp in Columbus, Ohio where I
                reside. I had a first career as a marketing and sales professional but was laid off amid the global
                pandemic. I realized job security and broad range of skills were essential to surviving this era of
                grave uncertainty. During my unemployment, I researched new career paths that would create more job
                security and allow me to accumulate wealth. It was then that I fell in love with coding. Stretches of
                hours can go by before I realize just how much time I have spent at the computer building, editing, and
                growing my skill set. I knew coding was a true hobby I could monetize into a successful career path. I
                am excited to see where this journey takes me, especially as a woman of color in an male dominated
                field, as i pivot into my second career. In my spare time, I love to travel, spend time with friends,
                family, my furbaby Momo, and paint.
            </p>
